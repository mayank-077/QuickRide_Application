##Modular Architecture: 

Designed a services-like structure with modular entities (User, Ride, Payment, Wallet, Rating) for 
efficient data management.

Integrated OSRM API for route optimization and used the Strategy Design Pattern to support surge pricing and fare strategies. 
Used Postgre SQL and PostGIS as the database.
